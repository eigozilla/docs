Your donation is a driving force for Eigozilla. Join us for ambitious initiatives. 

## Why your donation matters

Editorial independence will never be achieved without finantial independence. We've decided not to ask any enterprises to sponsor our project. Rather, we ask passionate individuals - like you - to donate us. From ¥500 one-time donation to ¥1,000/mo subscription, there are ways to support us. However you choose, we are deeply grateful. 

## How your donation help us

Your donation will be used to maintain and boost the project. Operating cost includes the regular expenses to host websites, use cloud platforms and subscribing with domain. 

## How you get rewarded
